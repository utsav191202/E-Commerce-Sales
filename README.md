This project aims to analyze sales data from an e-commerce platform to gain insights into customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends. The dataset consists of sales data from an online retailer, including customer demographics (age, gender, location), product information (product ID, category, price), sales data (date, time, quantity, revenue), and order information (order ID, customer ID, order date). The dataset contains approximately 10,000 rows and 21 columns.
